# Belly Button Biodiversity 

[View Belly Button Biodiversity Dashboard](https://sherizig.github.io/BiodiversityChallenge/)

## Overview 
Rosa is a biological researcher. She has partnered with a company called Improbable Beef. They are trying to discover bacteria that contains synthesized proteins that taste like beef. Rosa has a hypothesis that the ideal species may be found within the human body. Specifically, the belly button. To test her hypothesis, she recruited individuals to participate in the study and have their belly button bacteria analyzed.
With the study complete, Rosa would like to present the findings via a dashboard with engaging, dynamic charts. Additionally, she wants the dashboard to be available to both fellow researchers and study participants. As part of the dashboard, the participants should be able to select their ID number from a list and view the data relating to the bacteria within their belly button. 

## Dashboard Summary  
The final dashboard contains a four visualization for the benefit of both study participants and researchers. The user can select a specific Subject ID from the drop-down list and the whole dashboard will update automatically to display the data specific to the selected Subject ID. 
The following elements are available on the dashboard. 
- Drop-down list contain Subject ID numbers
- Demographic information for the subject
- Horizontal bar chart visualizing the Top 10 Bacteria Cultures Found
- Gauge with a range from one to ten that visualizes the Belly Button Washing Frequency
- Bubble chart to visualize the amount and type of bacteria per sample
